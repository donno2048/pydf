_python.pdf_ is a pdf that is a runnable python code, look at the pdf, it looks just like four dots (actually it's two colons) now run it in python and it'll print ::

_c.pdf_ is the same thing but in C, the only difference is that even though `python3 python.pdf` **will** work if you try to compile _c.pdf_ you'll get an error, you could do that: `gcc -xc c.pdf -o main` then to run it just use `./main`
